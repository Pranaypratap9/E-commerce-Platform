# E-commerce-Platform
The project aims to develop a Java-based E-Commerce Web Application that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, place orders, and for admins to manage products and inventory. The solution includes clear requirement analysis, use-case diagrams, ER diagrams, class diagrams, and logical workflow charts.
